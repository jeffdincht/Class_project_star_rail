# Course Fan Page Project

In this project I was told to create a fan page with some of the things I've learned from the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap course.

The project consists in 3 static pages:
* Home Page
    - Bootstrap carousel;
    - Info text with CSS styles;
    - External links;
    - iFrame videos from YouTube;
* Character Page
    - Info text with CSS styles;
    - Cards with CSS animation;
* Contact:
  - Contact form from bootstrap;
* All Pages have:
  - Header & Footer;
  - Footer is always on bot (Css styled);
  - Gif background;
